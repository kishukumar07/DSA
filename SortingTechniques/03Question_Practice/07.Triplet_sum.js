/*Given an array of integers , find if there Exists two numbers in the array whose sum is equal to the third number c , which is also present in  the array
ie ..  a+b=c
if there exist any such triplet in the array output 1 else 0.
Note : a,b,c all need to be different indices 
ie.. you can not use any element twice ... */


// approach1. brute force  
// approach 2. optimal approach two ptr
