//goal: To find the index of given key in sorted and rotated array
 
//Technique : =>   we 'll find the mid and we know both left and right part is sorted in itself 
// and we also know finding the key index in sorted array ...
// that's all needed to solve this question ....
//we'll divide the main array in two part and will try to find the key's index for both part recursively 
//oky we got the technique...
